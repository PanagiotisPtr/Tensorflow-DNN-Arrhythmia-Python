# Feed Forward DNN in Tensorflow
Feed Forward Deep Neural Network in Python with Tensorflow that diagnoses arrhythmia patients.

### What is this project for?
This project is mostly an applications from what I have read from the "Deep Learning" Book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. It is a neural netowrk written in Python using the Tensorflow API that diagnoses patients with arrythmia. It uses techniques tought in the book, such as early stopping, regularization terms etc.
You are welcome to read the code and replicate the results.

##### Disclaimer
This project isn't meant for production and is mostly an experimentation. I still am a novice Python programmer and as such the code design isn't all that great

##### Foot note
I hope that you find this project informative and educational. Keep on learning!
